iOS 14 Contacts App. You can use this theme for your next React Native contacts app. I came across Contacts App UI Kit [Free download for Sketch] by AL Design on dribble.com.

And decided to code it in React Native.

## How download and use

Download or clone the project files. Open the parent folder. There are additional two folders. Light Mode and Dark Mode.

Note: You must have the following installed on your computer:

 - Nodejs
 - React Native CLI
 - Expo CLI

Open your terminal and CD into any of the project folder you want to run and type:

    yarn

This will install all the required dependencies.

After that, run `expo start or yarn start` to start the expo server.

Enjoy!!!
